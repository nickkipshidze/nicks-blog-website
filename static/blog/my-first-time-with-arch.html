        <span>================ MY FIRST TIME WITH ARCH LINUX ================</span><br>
        <br>
        <span style="color: #6E92F2;">[ DESC ] In this blog I want to talk about my first time using Arch Linux. Especially what horrors I had to go through when trying to install it. Arch Linux is known for it's simplicity and lack of useless trash called bloatware, or bloat for short. But where there's simplicity, there is difficulty.</span><br>

        <span style="color: #CDBC5C;">[ SUBTITLE ] Introduction</span><br>
        <span>---</span><br>
        <span>So... the first time I found out about Arch, I was 14 years of age. I was a silly 14 year old teenager. And just like every 14 year old teenagers do, I went through my period of DISTRO HOPPING. Distro hopping is referred to that moment in your self-exploration where you go on a journey to find the perfect Linux distribution for yourself. Many get lost in the deep bloat of Ubunty and Debian in this search. But those who prevail will reach the promised land of TRUE FREEDOM. The GNU wonderland! Free as in FREEDOM! No bloatware. Powerful and lightweight. It's the Arch Linux. And that's the journey I went through.</span><br>
        <br>

        <span style="color: #CDBC5C;">[ SUBTITLE ] The distro journey</span><br>
        <span>---</span><br>
        <span>I started with a virtual machine, just like everyone else does. I used Oracle's VirtualBox and setup a fresh installation of Ubuntu. The most common and supposedly user-friendly distribution. I got the hang of it pretty soon. I did most of the work in there. I slowly copied over my documents and work over on the VM, and I got fully immersed inside it. I learned how the terminal worked, the file system, permissions, users. And soon enough I learned about rest of the Linux culture and it's ideology. Although, Ubuntu couldn't satisfy all of my needs. I wanted more! I wanted to learn some more programming, and I've heard that Kali Linus is pretty good for programming... and exploitation. I installed it, stayed on it for couple weeks. I like it but it's not my type. I moved onto Fedora Linux. It was a nightmare, don't install Fedora. I went back to Kali. I did more research. At this point I had completely forgotten I was still using a VM on my Windows 10 host. But this will soon change. WHEN I FOUND OUT ABOUT ARCH LINUX.</span><br>

        <span>---</span><br>
        <span>Arch Linux is the heaven, and it's gates are the installation process itself! When they say it's hard. They mean it's HARD. But the reward is very nice indeed. FREE to do whatever you want with your machine. FREE to install and uninstall whatever you want, that includes the kernel itself. Damn it! When I installed Arch on my server, I didn't like the kernel on it. So instead I installed the zen version. SO ANYWAY! When I first started learning how to install this bad boy on a VM, it wasn't easy. I failed 14 times with the partitioning and formatting, but I was still motivated to go further. But when I succeeded to format the disks on my 15th try, and waited couple hours for the packages to be installed with pacstrap, only to find out that something got corrupted! That broke me. I was absolutely demotivated to go any further...</span><br>
        <br>
        <span>Unrelated note: I blame all of my mental health issues to Arch Linux. Installing this was truly a spiritual adventure as much as it was a technical disaster. Anyway back to the installation...</span><br>
        <br>
        <span>I was broken beyond repair. But I took a break. And when I say "break", I mean 5 minutes. Then I returned and I installed everything perfectly, I did everything the manual instructed me to do. #RTFM. AND THEN! Then I rebooted my installation to be greeted with a WHOLE LOT OF NOTHING! Looks like I did indeed install the kernel, oh yes. I installed Linux. But Linux is just the DAMN KERNEL! And kernel is not the OS itself. And operating system is made up of bunch of parts that all together make up the OS. That includes the kernel, bootloader, terminal software, maybe even a deskop environment, a file system too. I was missing the bootloader. A good bootloader to use with Arch is grub, next time I knew...</span><br>
        <br>
        <span>I saw the black screen. Hours of work wasted once again. I felt as if my keyboard had electrocuted me. That didn't happen obviously, but the effects were real. I almost passed out. ALMOST! I painfully deleted that VM's disk, and tried again. I knew that each time I failed, I learned something new. Each failure meant more knowledge, and that's life... y'know? When I tried again I finally got the bootloader to work. YES! I rebooted the VM once again and it WORKED! I was able to use my distribution. But wait... what's this? Still in the terminal?! Well... yeah. I didn't install any desktop environment. So I used the terminal for couple weeks. Even though I could easily install a DE with one command. And that's how I got on Arch Linux.</span><br>
